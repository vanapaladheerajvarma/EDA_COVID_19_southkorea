           <h3>Observation</h3>
	   <font>Here we can see That earlier There were many confirmed_cases and actually recovery of patients started from 02-17-2020 and as the time past raising of infected cases started decreasing and released_cases started incresing and after again we can see more confirmed cases but during that they are many people recoverd as well but we donot have proper data regarding it</font>

           <h3>Observation</h3>
