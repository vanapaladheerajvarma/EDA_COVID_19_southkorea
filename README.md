## OBSERVATIONS FROM DATA ANALYSIS

 - <font color='BULE'>DAEGU IS THE PROVIENCE WHICH HAS 64.3% OF CONFIRMED CASES IN SOUTH KOREA</font>

 - <font color='BULE'>SO THE PEOPLE OF DAEGU PROVIENCE SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL TILL THIS INFECTION ENDS </font>
 
 - <font color='BULE'>Groups are highly responisible for the infection spread</font>
 
 - <font color='BULE'>So there is the high chance the you will be infected if you are not isolated from various groups
 
  - <font color='GREEN'>Shincheonji Church Is THE EPI CENTER IN SOUTH KOREA For The Infection Spread</font>
  
  - <font color='orange'>Contant With Patient Is Also The Main Reason For The Infection Spread</font>
  
  - <font color='orange'>Most of Patients who are infected are around the age group of 20 years</font>
  
  - <font color='orange'>Here Roughly speaking all the age group are effected by the infection so no age is immune to this infection</font>
  
  - <font color='violet'>As Expected since all these Cases are in south Korea we can see almost all the effected people are from same country iteself and very few people     from other countries</font>
  
  
  - <font color='green'>46.8% of Female population are Effected</font>
  
  - <font color='green'>Most of the people who effected are Females</font>
  
  - <font color='green'>Roughly speaking both male and female are similary Effected so infection spread doesnot depend of sex much</font>
  
  - <font color='green'>Here we can see that the Number of confirmed Cases for Female is little bit high than the confirmed Cases for male.The Reason is more Feamles are     effected to virus than males</font>
  
  - <font color='green'>Also we can see there fairly the Number of recovered Cases for Male and Female are almost Similar</font>
